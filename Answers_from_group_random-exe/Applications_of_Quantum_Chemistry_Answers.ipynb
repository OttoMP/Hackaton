    "### Jordan-Wigner Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Jordan-Wigner transformation** is used to map fermionic operators onto qubit operators. This is necessary because quantum computers work with qubits rather than fermions. The **Pauli-Z operator** plays a crucial role in this mapping due to the need to preserve the anti-commutation relations of fermionic operators.\n",

    "For Fermionic operators on the same site we have the following anti-commutation relation:\n",
    "$$\\{f_j, f_j^\\dagger\\} = 1,$$\n",
    "and for Fermionic operators on the different sites we have the following anti-commutation relations:\n",
    "$$\\quad \\{f_j, f_k\\} = \\{f_j^\\dagger, f_k^\\dagger\\} = \\{f_j, f_k^\\dagger\\} = 0$$\n",
    "where $f_j^\\dagger$ and $f_j$ are fermionic creation and annihilation operators. To represent these operators on a qubit, we need to ensure that their anti-commutation properties are preserved. The Jordan-Wigner transformation achieves this by converting fermionic creation and annihilation operators into qubit operators using Pauli matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single fermionic mode $j$, the Jordan-Wigner transformation maps the creation ($f_j^\\dagger$) and annihilation ($f_j$) operators as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_j^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{2} (X_j - iY_j) \\otimes Z_0 \\otimes Z_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes Z_{j-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_j = \\frac{1}{2} (X_j + iY_j) \\otimes Z_0 \\otimes Z_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes Z_{j-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $X_j$, $Y_j$, and $Z_j$ are the Pauli operators acting on the $j$-th qubit, and the $Z_0 \\otimes Z_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes Z_{j-1}$ string of Pauli-Z operators appears for all qubits before the $j$-th one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Pauli-Z is Necessary:\n",
    "The Pauli-Z operators are essential in the Jordan-Wigner transformation because they enforce the correct anti-commutation relations between fermionic creation and annihilation operators when mapped onto qubits. This anti-commutation property is not naturally present in qubit operators like $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, which follow commutation relations. To ensure that qubit operators reflect the anti-commutation of fermionic operators, a string of Pauli-Z operators is introduced in the Jordan-Wigner transformation. These Pauli-Z operators essentially track whether a fermion has been \"created\" or \"annihilated\" on other qubits, ensuring that the proper sign change occurs. Without these Pauli-Z strings, the qubit representation would not correctly reflect the physics of fermions."

    "The total energy of a quantum system is represented by operator H. We know that an initial quantum state |ψ⟩ evolves over time through the action of the evolution operator U , defined as $$U(t) = exp[-iHt]$$ However, it’s possible to build quantum circuits that approximates the realization of U(t), being one of these methods knows as Trotterization. If we can write H as $$H = \\sum_{i=1}^k H_i$$ of a number k of Hermitian operators $H_i$ that do not necessarily commute, we can approximate U(t) via $$U(t) \\approx \\prod_{j=1}^n\\prod_{i=1}^k exp\\left( -\\frac{iH_it}{n} \\right)$$ with each term in the j-product called trotter step. The larger n is, i.e. more trotter\n",
